				<h1>Unschooling Is Personal</h1>
				<h1>Unschooling Is Personal</h1>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>unschooling is not listening to other people telling you how to unschool your kids.</strong><br>
If you’re going to Peter, Paul, Sally, and Suzie and listening to them instead of your kids, that’s <em>schoolishness</em>. To think you need an authority other than your child to educate them is not unschooling.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Perspective</h2>
<p>If you go to <strong>Danii, Akilah, Sue, Esther, Melissa, or Meghan</strong>, come not for your kids and unschooling.</p>
<p>Come for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deschooling</strong> — breaking the old programming that tells you anyone knows more than you and your child about their needs and interests.</li>
<li><strong>Your own adult unschooling</strong> — reparenting yourself, building community, and nerdy connections we don’t get from co-workers.
<ul>
<li>Co-workers are like snot-nosed minis who have to be told <strong>7 days a week</strong> to brush their teeth, wipe their butts, and understand the importance of clean underwear.</li>
<li>Ooh, can’t forget my favorite: <strong>shirts are not napkins</strong>, especially the ones we’re wearing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, my kids are wild and free, but they don’t need to remain beasts that drain my wallet for new clothing sooner than the budget allows. That’s just my 2 cents on my kids.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The 1 Cent Rule</h2>
<p>What’s your <strong>1 cent</strong>, your child’s <strong>1 cent</strong>, and their other parent/guardian/guide’s <strong>1 cent</strong>?<br>
That’s the <strong>only narrative and negotiation</strong> that matters when asking: <em>What is unschooling and what can it look like?</em></p>
<p>I’m on a mission to tell <strong>1001 tales about unschooling and the lives of unschoolers</strong>, because every other book or show out there is stuck in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kindergarten → elementary → high school → college</li>
<li>Cookie-cutter marriage → kids → rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s not reality. In a world where <strong>Netflix is boss</strong> — yes, Netflix, please call me — we can open the gates of what life can truly be like, without shame, blame, bullies, the Joneses, or thinking our kids will suffer without the status quo blueprint.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Unschooling is:</strong><br>
A way of life where your child’s interests, curiosity, and choices drive their learning. It’s less about “covering curriculum” and more about <strong>trusting the child as the expert on their own education</strong>. You provide resources, support, and guidance — but the path is theirs to create. It’s messy, unpredictable, joyful, and real.</p>
<p><strong>Deschooling is:</strong><br>
The process of undoing old habits, societal programming, and expectations that tell us that adults, authorities, or institutions know better than our children. It’s <strong>rewiring both parent and child</strong> to let curiosity, intrinsic motivation, and natural rhythms lead. It’s slow, it’s challenging, and it’s essential before unschooling can truly take hold.</p>
<p><strong>Worldschooling is:</strong><br>
Learning through <strong>real-world experience, travel, and cultural immersion</strong>. The world itself becomes the classroom — museums, markets, forests, cities, communities. Learning is <strong>hands-on, global, and integrated into life</strong>, not separated into subjects or schedules. The goal is perspective, adaptability, and meaningful context.</p>
<p><strong>Homeschooling is:</strong><br>
A structured or semi-structured education at home. Parents choose curriculum, plan lessons, and often replicate the “school” model in a home setting. Learning is <strong>parent-directed</strong>, even if done with love and flexibility. Homeschooling can overlap with unschooling, but it usually <strong>retains the authority of an adult-designed framework</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Directed Learning is:</strong><br>
The skill and habit of <strong>choosing what, when, and how you learn</strong>. It can apply to children, teens, and adults alike. This is the backbone of unschooling — <strong>learning driven by curiosity and purpose</strong>, not by mandates or external reward systems. It’s lifelong, portable, and infinitely adaptable.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Parents as Lifelong Learners</h2>
<p>Parents <strong>can be unschoolers</strong> too — life-long learners applying their knowledge and embodied experiences into endeavors that are <strong>not jobs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jobs:</strong> Services and goods provided on someone else’s terms for your life.</li>
<li><strong>Business, venture, endeavor, project:</strong> Services and goods provided on your own terms for your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>One looks and feels like forced labor, with penalties and punishments dished out.<br>
The other is hard work you can pick up and put down as you see fit, with the benefit of rest and mental health care.</p>
<hr>
<p>You considered it. You chose it. You lived it.<br>
<strong>Welcome to unschooling.</strong></p>
