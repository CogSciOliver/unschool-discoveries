				<h1>Unschooling Lab Notes</h1>
				<h1>Unschooling Lab Notes</h1>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>unschooling is NOT listening to other people telling you how to unschool your kids.</strong><br>
If you’re going to Peter, Paul, Sally, and Suzie and taking their advice instead of listening to your kids… that’s schoolishness.<br>
(Think: “I need an authority other than my kid to educate them.” Nope. Not unschooling.)</p>
<hr>
<h2>Perspective</h2>
<p>If you go to <strong>Danii, Akilah, Sue, Esther, Melissa, or Meghan</strong>, come <strong>not for your kids</strong>. Come for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deschooling</strong> – breaking the old programming that says anyone knows more than you and your kid about what they actually need or want.</li>
<li><strong>Adult unschooling &amp; reparenting</strong> – because, let’s be honest, our co-workers are like tiny snot-nosed minis who need reminders seven days a week to:
<ul>
<li>brush their teeth</li>
<li>wipe their butts</li>
<li>wear clean underwear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And one personal favorite: <strong>shirts are not napkins</strong>, especially the ones we’re wearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, my kids are wild and free, but they don’t need to remain wallet-draining beasts of chaos. That’s my 2 cents.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The 1-Cent Rule</h2>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s <strong>your 1 cent</strong>?</li>
<li>What’s <strong>your child’s 1 cent</strong>?</li>
<li>What’s <strong>their other parent/guardian/guide’s 1 cent</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the <strong>only narrative and negotiation that matters</strong> when asking:<br>
<em>&quot;What is unschooling? What can it look like?&quot;</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Why I Tell 1001 Tales</h2>
<p>Everything else out there is stuck in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kindergarten → Elementary → High School → College</li>
<li>Cookie-cutter marriage → kids → rinse → repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>(Not reality. Not even close.)</p>
<p>In a world where Netflix is boss — yes, Netflix, call me — we can finally open the gates of what life can actually look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>No shame</li>
<li>No blame</li>
<li>No bullies</li>
<li>No Joneses</li>
<li>No worrying that your kid will “suffer” without the status quo blueprint</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Unschooling is:</strong><br>
A way of life where your child’s interests, curiosity, and choices drive their learning. It’s less about “covering curriculum” and more about <strong>trusting the child as the expert on their own education</strong>. You provide resources, support, and guidance — but the path is theirs to create. It’s messy, unpredictable, joyful, and real.</p>
<p><strong>Deschooling is:</strong><br>
The process of undoing old habits, societal programming, and expectations that tell us that adults, authorities, or institutions know better than our children. It’s <strong>rewiring both parent and child</strong> to let curiosity, intrinsic motivation, and natural rhythms lead. It’s slow, it’s challenging, and it’s essential before unschooling can truly take hold.</p>
<p><strong>Worldschooling is:</strong><br>
Learning through <strong>real-world experience, travel, and cultural immersion</strong>. The world itself becomes the classroom — museums, markets, forests, cities, communities. Learning is <strong>hands-on, global, and integrated into life</strong>, not separated into subjects or schedules. The goal is perspective, adaptability, and meaningful context.</p>
<p><strong>Homeschooling is:</strong><br>
A structured or semi-structured education at home. Parents choose curriculum, plan lessons, and often replicate the “school” model in a home setting. Learning is <strong>parent-directed</strong>, even if done with love and flexibility. Homeschooling can overlap with unschooling, but it usually <strong>retains the authority of an adult-designed framework</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Directed Learning is:</strong><br>
The skill and habit of <strong>choosing what, when, and how you learn</strong>. It can apply to children, teens, and adults alike. This is the backbone of unschooling — <strong>learning driven by curiosity and purpose</strong>, not by mandates or external reward systems. It’s lifelong, portable, and infinitely adaptable.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Parents as Lifelong Learners</h2>
<p>Parents <strong>can be unschoolers too</strong> — applying knowledge and life experience into endeavors that are <strong>not jobs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jobs:</strong> Services or goods provided on someone else’s terms.</li>
<li><strong>Business, venture, endeavor, project:</strong> Services or goods provided on your own terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>One feels like forced labor with penalties and punishments.<br>
The other is hard work you can pick up and put down, with the benefit of rest, sanity, and mental health care.</p>
<hr>
<p>You considered it.<br>
You chose it.<br>
You lived it.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to unschooling.</strong></p>
